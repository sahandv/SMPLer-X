"""SMPLx Optimiser

Track_players_across_frames: This function ensures that players are consistently tracked across frames. In practice, you'd use a tracking algorithm like DeepSORT or MMTracking.
fit_smplx_to_keypoints: Optimizes the SMPL-X parameters (body pose, shape, orientation) to fit the keypoints of each player.
process_frames_and_players: Loops through each frame and each player, fitting SMPL-X to their keypoints and saving the resulting parameters.
Short Snippet for Future Reference:
This code processes multi-player, multi-frame SMPL-X fitting based on motion capture keypoints and can be extended for real-time or large-scale datasets.
